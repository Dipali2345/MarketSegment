# U.K Impression Die Forging Market 2025 Explained in Detailed Segmentation [2025-2033]

<strong>Impression Die Forging Market Snapshot 2025-2033:</strong>

In most of the impression die forging processes, a succession of impression dies are used to modify the material into the final desired shape or form. This process involves two dies, each containing a single impression or a series of multiple impressions that cut into each die. Typically, the bottom die is fixed in a set position and the upper die is generally raised at a height. While they are separated, desired quantity of metal is heated to a particular temperature and is positioned between them. Extreme amount of force is then applied to deform the metal, and it is forced to flow into the die chambers while the excess is removed. Two types of pressing equipment are generally used for impression die forging process: mechanical forging and hydraulic forging.
